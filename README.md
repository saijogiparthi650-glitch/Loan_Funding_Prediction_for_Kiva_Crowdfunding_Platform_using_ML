# Loan_Funding_Prediction_for_Kiva_Crowdfunding_Platform_using_ML
Minor Project-Loan Funding Prediction for Kiva Crowdfunding Platform using ML

Overview

This project predicts whether a loan posted on the Kiva crowdfunding platform will get funded using Machine Learning.
The goal is to help understand how different loan attributes influence funding outcomes.

Problem Statement

Kiva receives thousands of loan requests from borrowers across the world.
Not all loans get funded at the same rate.
This project uses historical Kiva loan data to predict loan funding status based on key features.

Tech Stack

.Python
.Pandas, NumPy
.Scikit-learn
.Flask
.HTML/CSS
.Pickle (for model persistence)

Machine Learning Model

Model Used: Random Forest Classifier(I trained several models and saved this as it is the best one)

How It Works

User enters loan details through the web interface
Input data is processed and passed to the trained ML model
The model predicts whether the loan is likely to be funded
Prediction result is displayed on the web page

Results

The model provides a prediction indicating whether a loan is likely to be funded based on the given inputs.
